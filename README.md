# Website Navigation Header

This project contains a responsive navigation header for a website, built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The navigation header includes links for Home, About, Contact, and History pages, along with three dropdown menus.

## Getting Started

To use the navigation header in your project, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Include the following files in your project directory:
   - index.html: Contains the HTML structure for the navigation header.
   - styles.css: Contains custom CSS styles for the navigation.
   - script.js: Contains JavaScript code for dropdown menu animations.

3. Link the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML file. You can either use CDN links or download the files locally.
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
   <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.5.4/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
   <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
   ```

4. Customize the navigation links and dropdown items in the `index.html` file according to your website's requirements.

5. Customize the visual styles in the `styles.css` file to match your website's design theme.

6. Optionally, customize the dropdown animations or functionality in the `script.js` file.

7. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the navigation header in action.

## Usage
